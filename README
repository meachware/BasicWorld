Basic World
***********

A possible starting point for Unity3D projects.  The BasicWorld scene contains:

1) A standard terrain,
2) A standard skybox,
3) Directional sunlight,
4) A third-person controller.

The YouGitIt Project (https://github.com/srfoster/YouGitIt) is bundled with this project.  This supports extending the basic world with any YouGitIt-friendly Unity3D projects hosted on GitHub.  See the YouGitIt project page for more information.
